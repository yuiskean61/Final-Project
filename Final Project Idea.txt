CPAN 226 Network Programming - Final Project Idea

Chat Application using Python:

Client and Server side
Server script that will wait for incoming messages from the clients
Different users that needs to log in for authentication (separate but exactly same client scripts)
Messages sent will be seen by all users who are logged in.

For example:
1 Server file/script
3 users = 3 client scripts (exactly same) but user will need to log in proper credentials
									- start with hard-coded credentials
									- can work on using registration if possible
									- SSL protocol maybe?
Run it on the same computer first to see if it works.

When the above work has been completed/verified that it works,
then implement, if possible, that users can log in from another computer, while one user, or one computer will only
be the Server script.






Online Server and Client script:
Server script IP address: 192.168.75.218
Firewall Configuration:
On the server computer, you may need to allow incoming connections on the port you're using (1024 in this case).
On Windows:
Open Windows Defender Firewall
Click on "Advanced settings"
Select "Inbound Rules" and create a new rule
Choose "Port", then specify TCP and port 1024
Allow the connection and apply to all network profiles


Running the Scripts:
On the server computer:
	Open Spyder
	Load the modified server script
Run the server script
	On the client computer(s):
	Open Spyder
	Load the modified client script
	Run the client script


Running the client script on VS code:
	Open VS code
	Go to the correct directory
	open terminal
	run "python client1.py" and so forth, make sure each client is running on its own terminal
