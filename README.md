Implementing Features Roles: 

User Authentication and Database (RYAN): 

    Start with implementing basic user authentication,

    MongoDB for database purposes; mainly where users data will be stored and chat history 

Enhance Current Functionality (TYLER): 

    Improve error handling and connection management 

    Refine the startup messages and user experience 

Private Messaging (TYLER): 

    This builds on your existing messaging system 

    It's a good stepping stone before implementing chatrooms 

Chatrooms (not as important, do after PM is implemented): 

    Implement after private messaging is working well 

    This feature significantly expands the app's capabilities 

Simple UI Improvements (EINON): 

    Enhance the console UI or start with a basic graphical interface 

    This will make testing and using the app more intuitive 

Other Features (anyone of us): 

    Rich text, emojis, user status, and detailed profiles can be added last 

    These are nice-to-have features that build on the core functionality
