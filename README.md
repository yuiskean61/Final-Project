Implementing Features Roles: 

**User Authentication and Database (RYAN): **

    Start with implementing basic user authentication, like adding a registration if possible

    Make 3 users for each of us to use!

    MongoDB for database purposes; mainly where users data will be stored and chat history



**Private Messaging (TYLER): **

    Allow users to privately message user using a specific command,

    Up to you how you would like to implement that,

    Either by creating a separate chatroom with the choses users or just using a direct message command

    

** Chatrooms (anyone of us) - not as important, do after PM is implemented: **

    Implement after private messaging is working well 


 ** Enhance Current Functionality (EINON):** 

    Add error handling and connection management 

    Refine the startup messages and user experience 

** UI Improvements (EINON): **

    Enhance the console UI or start with a basic graphical interface to make it look more appealing,
    
    I will try my best to make it look more like a messaging app

    This will make testing and using the app more intuitive 
    

 ** Other Features (anyone of us): **  

    Rich text, emojis, user status, and detailed profiles can be added too to make a more robust app

    These features can be added by any of us if possible, but focus on the  main features above first
